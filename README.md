To let this application run in HTTPS, I needed a certificate.

**In production-grade applications, certificates are issued from renowned Certification Authorities (CA) to ensure that our application is a trusted entity.**

However, as this is a tutorial, we will create a Self-Signed Certificate and use it in our application.

We can create one using Java **keytool** utility to create and manage certificates locally.

keytool is available in JDK_HOME/bin directory.
